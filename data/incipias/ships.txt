	description "The Nimbus is the first spaceship that was really able to navigate through a system built by the Incipias. Since it was first published it is loved among wealthier captains and a dream of captains who just started."
	description "Although the Nimbus is labeled as a medium warship, it is a multi-purpose ship. Whether one uses it for mining, passengers or cargo it will fulfill its job in the most pleasant way. It is only occasionally used in combat because the Incipias are not fighting open wars."
