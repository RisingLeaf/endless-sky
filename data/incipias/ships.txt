	description "The Nimbus is the first spaceship that the Incipias built that was really able to navigate through a system. Since it was first manufactured it has been loved among wealthier captains and a dream of captains just starting out."
	description "Although the Nimbus is labeled as a medium warship, it is a multi-purpose ship. Whether one uses it for mining, passengers or cargo it will perform its job nicely. It is only occasionally used in combat because the Incipias are not fighting open wars."
