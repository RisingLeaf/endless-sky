	description "The Incipias started to mine asteroids long before they started space travel due to the proximity of their planet's rings. As a result this mining tool seems to be more advanced than their general technology, yet it is still not comparable to the efficiency of human weapons."
	description "The weapon itself shoots bolts of high density plasma that split up into small particles after some time. Because of the plasma infuser the fire rate is exceptional, but the energy usage is severe."

	description "The Tractor Beam is one of the few technologies of the Incipias that surpasses anything humanity has made thus far - in fact, the first prototypes were built before the Incipias dreamed of space travel. Giant reactors were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit for easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes."
	description "As the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency - this allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models - much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships."
	description "Officially, these beams are used for mining operations; however, less scrupulous individuals have found they are equally valuable in combat, using the beams to lock down and pull in their opponents."
	description "The secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences."

	"outfit space" -60
	"shield generation" .1
	"energy generation" 4.2
	"heat generation" 5
	description "Shield technology is one of the most recent developments of the Incipias. While this shield appears similar to a human shield device, it works on a completely different base. In its core hydrogen is burned that provides energy for regeneration, but because scientists saw a more efficient use of this burning technology, the Incipias also made it the main power source of all of their ships."

	mass 80
	"outfit space" -90
	"shield generation" .25
	"energy generation" 6.1
	"heat generation" 6
	description "This more advanced shield generator burns a liquid instead of a gas. This raises the efficiency considerably but also requires some extra structures, making this outfit popular only on larger ships."

	category "Systems"
	mass 100
	"outfit space" -120
	"shield generation" .45
	"energy generation" 6
	"heat generation" 8
	description "This shield generator is pure efficiency. It burns its input in stages from solid in the center to a gaseous state in the outer hull. Sadly this efficiency requires a lot of adjusting systems to stabilize the process, and therefore only the heaviest warships make use of the Solid-Class Shield."

outfit "Liquid Hydrogen Cell"
	category "Power"
	thumbnail "outfit/liquid hydrogen cell"
	mass 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"energy capacity" 500
	description "This form of energy storage was discovered early by the Incipias because of the great amount of hydrogen on their homeworld. Because Incipias ships mostly access its energy at the time it is produced, only a small amount of storage is needed. Most of their ships have only one cell installed as a consequence."

	description "Even the Incipias realize that ships need to turn towards their target to be able to shoot it. These steerings are specifically designed for combat but capatains with a lot of money find it very useful for mining."
