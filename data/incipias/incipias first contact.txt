			`	Only a moment later the Quarg returns with another Quarg. The new one starts talking with a very strange accent.`

			`You land on one of the automised landing pads. As soons as you shut your engines off it starts to move into a hangar slot. The gates of the hangar close. You leave your ship and notice a door on the side of the hangar, a sign there is showing something in a foreign language, but as you get closer it turns white for a moment, before the words "HUMAN DETECTED, PLEASE WAIT WHILE ASSISTANCE IS ON THE WAY" appear. Left with no other choice you have to stay where you are.`
			`	Luckily it only takes a few minutes until the doors open and three Quarg appear behind it. The one in the middle is wearing clothing that makes clear that it is a military official. The two in the back are wearing full combat gear but do not seem to expect a fight. The one in the middle starts talking in a very strange accent.`

			`	"What a peculiar task that is," it looks confused and tilts its head, "what to achieve by this you hope? That an incredible amount of dangers come with meeting other species you not know? For a reason invisible borders in space there are. To be careful and consider every last step I advice."`
			label "end"
			`	After a short pause it continues talking, "Your presence here our kind accepts, although not very happy we are. Allowed to travel here you are, but conditions there are. Not too far from here another kind just starts growing, great plans for them our leaders have. Do not interrupt them, hostile actions against them we will revenge."`
			`	With these words the Quarg turns around and leaves. It seems like you are free to use the local facilities now.`

				`When you approach the ship you get hailed and as you accept the hail color gradients start moving over your screen but your speakers stay silent. It seems like communication over these channels is doomed to fail, you continue your boarding maneuver.`

				`	You manage to dock to the disabled ship quite easily. The lock opens and a hallway opens up before you, obviously not built for humans, the walls are strangely curved and the floor has nearly no grip at all. But your view gets caught by the five giant aliens half octopode, half jellyfish, they are pulsating in bright colors, similar to the gradients that appeared on your screen earlier. One of them is floating behind a giant mounted gun, the two barrels are pointed right at you. The gunner flashes in an orange light, and you can feel the tension in the room rising.`

				`	Feeling that the situation could escalate every moment, you slowly place the crate with the repair equipment on the ground, careful to not make any hasty movements and walk back a few steps. No side moves for a moment until one of the aliens slowly moves forward, tones of yellow are now mixing into the orange. Two of their tentacles wrap around the crate, the other four are backing of a little bit. The front one succeeds in finding the opening mechanism, right after it got a look inside, its colors shift to a weak green. The other four also seem to relax as they take on the same color.`
				`	With the repair equipment delivered there is nothing else you can do and communication is not working so you turn around and leave. Just as you leave you can see how the aliens start pulsating in all colors of the spectrum, gradients are moving over their skin so fast that it almost looks white.`
					goto end
				label flee
				`	As the tension starts raising even further, you just drop the repair equipment and run back into your ship, you smash the button that closes the lock. You get a last look on the alien, blue and yellow tones are mixing on their skin, but they are not taking any action.`
				label end
				`	Apparently they figured how to use the repair equipment, as you fly away the engines of the ship are booting back up.`
				`	Back on the bridge your eyes fall on the scanner log that is still open on your screen, notably this ship had no Hyperdrive or anything similar installed, how strange considering there is no inhabitated planet in this system.`
