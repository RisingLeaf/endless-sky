## Installing the game

Official releases of Endless Sky are available as direct downloads from [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/latest), on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404410/Endless_Sky/), and on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.endless_sky.endless_sky). Other package managers may also include the game, though the specific version provided may not be up-to-date.

## System Requirements

Endless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game. The most restrictive requirement is likely that your device must support at least OpenGL 3.

|| Minimum | Recommended |
|---|----:|----:|
|RAM | 750 MB | 2 GB |
|Graphics | OpenGL 3.0 | OpenGL 3.3 |
|Storage Free | 350 MB | 1.5 GB |

## Building from source

Development is done using [CMake](https://cmake.org) to compile the project. Most popular IDEs are supported through their respective CMake integration. [SCons](https://scons.org/) was the primary build tool up until 0.9.16, and some files and information continue to be available for it.

For full installation instructions, consult the [Build Instructions](docs/readme-cmake.md) readme.

## Contributing

As a free and open source game, Endless Sky is the product of many people's work. Contributions of artwork, storylines, and other writing are most in-demand, though there is a loosely defined [roadmap](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap). Those who wish to [contribute](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) are encouraged to review the [wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), and to post in the [community-run Discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) beforehand. Those who prefer to use Steam can use its [discussion rooms](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/) as well, or GitHub's [discussion zone](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions).

Endless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users, and should not be used anymore.
